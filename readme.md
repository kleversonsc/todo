## About this project

>Study and practice of JavaScript and DOM manipulation 

A simple ToDo written with HTML, CSS and JS vanilla. Entirely based on [this](https://github.com/alura-cursos/1823_DOM) repository which refers directly to a course of [Alura Cursos Online](http://www.alura.com.br/).

The difference is the `<div>` element wrapping the buttons in each task item to better manipulate, within CSS, the positioning of them. 

On this v1.0 there are basic elements of a To-do list: add, complete and delete a task but still without data persistence.
